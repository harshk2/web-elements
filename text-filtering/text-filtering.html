    	</figure>The research paper remains the most common writing assignment on college campuses, more popular than ever (Lunsford, 2008). In the first year, just as students are encountering the conventions of academic writing, we also hope to ground them in the mechanics of using a print/digital hybrid library, probably much larger than any they’ve ever used before, to make informed choices among possible sources, and extract meaning from them in order to support a well-organized synthesis or argument. We know they will be asked to do this in the future, so we try to get them acculturated quickly.

  <p>The research paper is a common rite of passage in the academic world. While students are typically successful at amassing information sources, many grapple with new conventions of academic discourse and the synthesis of these foreign concepts into their own writing. Furthermore, research assignment guidelines that focus on the number or type of sources can lead students to view information as an object, and to conceive of research as a bounded, static product rather than grasping the dynamic and collaborative nature of inquiry.</p>
  <p>Social bookmarking sites such as Diigo can help shift the focus from a final product to the experience of inquiry, as well as repositioning research as active dialog. First, Diigo enables the quick and easy bookmarking of the various informal conversations that lead to formal scholarship. Students’ exposure to conversation in context (blogs, tweets, discussion) breaks down academic barriers by helping their understanding of research as an active conversation. This focus on the context also means that students can provide much more purposeful critical evaluation of sources rather than following teacher-imposed criteria.</p>
  <p>Second, the participatory nature of social bookmarking in the class Diigo library mimics the interconnected nature of research and the social construction of knowledge. By enabling students to work collaboratively and draw on other students’ work and expertise, research becomes more active and meaningful. Finally, the social nature of Diigo means that students are curating a set of topical resources within a community as one would in civic, social, or academic environments. This provides an audience beyond the teacher, making research activities more authentic.</p>
